What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A respository is initailized with 0 commits. The reason we need this is to keep track of the commits that are
done to the respository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is temporary area that holds files that will be committed to the respository, one, some, if not all 
to the files. The working directory just shows the current files that exist. The value that the staging area offers
is that it allows the ability to to committ files separately, which in turn makes for coding because it makes it easier
to identify bugs in the program files. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area can be used to commit one logical change at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
one situation where branches are helpful is when you want to change the head of the commits but leave the rest of
the commit history alone. for example making a fix for the head, trying out an experimental feature,making a mode 
where a game is easier to play or changing the head so that it is in a different language like italian.
